Project 5 - Neighborhood Map Project

The maps contains 10 popular CrossFit gyms in Columbus Ohio.  

Created with HTML, CSS, javaScript, Knockout, jQuery, and the Yelp API.

To run the application open index.html.

Will run in most modern browsers.

The list of locations featured is on the left of the screen.  The search box filters both the list and the markers on the map.

A list item or marker when clicked displays an info window with information from Yelp about the location.
